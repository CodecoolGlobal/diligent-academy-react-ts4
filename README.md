### Form Tasks

- Simple form: Create a form where a user can input their `name` and `email`. Display the entered data on the screen in real time.
- Text field validation: Expand the form so that the user must enter a `password`. The `password` must be at least 8 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.
- Select fields: Expand the form so that the user can select a `country` from a `dropdown list`. Use the backend server to get the `countries`.
- Checkbox fields: Expand the form so that the user can select multiple options. (Options are up to You)
- Radio button fields: Expand the form so that the user can select only one option. (Options are up to You)
- Dynamic forms: Expand the form so that the user can add new fields.
- File uploads: Expand the form so that the user can upload an image.
- API communication: Expand the form so that the user can enter a `username`, and the form calls the `usernames` API to check if the `username` exists.
- Async validation: Expand the form so that the user must enter a username, and the form asynchronously checks if the username is available.
